-
Q8. Wrong operator precedence (Level 2 - Medium)
Question: A junior expects 60. What do you explain?

Options:
  1. Multiplication happens before addition, so result is 20 unless parentheses are used
  2. Addition always happens first, so result is 60
  3. The code will crash
  4. 2 * 5 is invalid
Answer: Multiplication happens before addition, so result is 20 unless parentheses are used

Question: Why does a change?
Code:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b.append(4)
PRINT a
Options:

  3. PRINT mutates arrays
  4. Lists are immutable
Answer: b references the same list; make a copy for b
-
Q15. Integer division (Level 3 - Hard)
Question: A learner expects 2.5. What's the issue?
Code:
avg = 5 / 2

  FOR each order IN orders
    IF order.userId == user.id
      total = total + order.amount
    END IF
  END FOR
END FOR
Options:

Question: What is the bug?
Code:
FUNCTION addItem(item, list = [])
  list.append(item)
  RETURN list
END FUNCTION

  3. PRINT mutates lists
  4. Functions cannot have defaults
Answer: The default list is reused across calls; create a new list each time
-
